# pbinspanish.hugo
Hugo project files for personal website.

## Notes
- The publish directory is set to `/pbinspanish.github.io` so builds automatically go to the submodule. This is set in `config.toml`. Anytime you read about publishing files to the `public` directory in the hugo docs, this is where it goes.

## TODO
- [ ] look into prettier for dealing with tailwind classes
	- [ ] run prettier when saving files
- [ ] mobile compatible navbar
- [ ] move away from static lucide icons to a tree-shakable method
- [ ] RSS
