I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Windsor who has a passion for technology, software, and creating useful things. I'm always looking for opportunities to help people solve real problems through the software I create, and it's even better if I get to chew on a fun technical problem to get there. At my last co-op at Magna, I constantly took initiative to make improvements to the development environment by streamlining the development process, and to the user experience by modernizing the look and feel of the web applications. Outside of tech, I love reading, being behind a camera, on my bike, or playing soccer. I'm constantly looking for opportunities to improve myself physically and mentally, and to connect and share with others.

Feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:josiahj.h@outlook.com) if you have any opportunities you think I would be interested in, or if there's anything interesting I've posted about you would like to discuss.
